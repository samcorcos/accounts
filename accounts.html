<!-- There are 4 login states that Meteor gives us and we have to account for all of them if we are going to create a custom Account UI.
1) They might be logged in, in which case, we have to give them the option to log out.
2) They might not be logged in, in which case we want to give them the option to log in.
3) And if they are not logged in, we might want to present them with the option to create an account.
4) The fourth state is the "logging in" state, where you want to show some kind of waiting signal while the user is logging in  -->
